Masterful Machinery is a forge minecraft mod written with modpack developers in mind. The mod was written to allow modpack developers to quickly and easily create processing Input/Output machines with multiple blocks, through the power of JSON files and datapacks.
It&amp;rsquo;s goal is to be enabling, whilst providing the flexibility and power to the more advanced users.
